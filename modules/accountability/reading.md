Anderson describes accountability through his experience from banks in
Chapter 10 “Banking and Bookkeeping” in  [@Anderson2008sea]. We will
also use the secure logging system of
@schneier1999secure [@schneier1999secure] as an example of how to
achieve secure logging in a challenging environment. The construction
described therein is a method to safely store audit logs in an untrusted
machine; in the scheme, all log entries generated prior to a compromise
will be impossible for the attacker to read, modify, or destroy
undetectably.
