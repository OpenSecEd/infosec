The course concludes with a project: [Applying security and usability in 
practice][project].

The report will be peer-reviewed by your colleagues before you hand it in for 
final assessment.
Upload your report below and then peer-review someone else's report.

Use the feedback you got from the peer-review to improve your report and then 
upload it for final assessment.
