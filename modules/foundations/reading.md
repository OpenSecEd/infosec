You should read Gollmann’s chapter on “Foundations of
Computer Security” [@Gollmann2011cs Ch. 3]. There he attempts at a
definition of Computer Security and related terms, confidentiality,
integrity, and availability, which we need for our treatment of the
topic. Anderson also covers this in Chapter 1 of [@Anderson2008sea]. He
also treats a wider area than just *computer* security, which is good
for us, he covers many aspects of security in different examples.

The scientific method is covered in “How to Design Computer Security
Experiments” [@HowToDesignSecurityExperiments]. This paper discusses the
scientific method of (parts of) the security field. For a more in-depth
reflection on the state of security as a scientific pursuit, we
recommend “SoK: Science, Security and the Elusive Goal of Security as a
Scientific Pursuit” [@SecurityAsAScience].

Anderson gives a short summary of the psychology of users, their
strengths and weaknesses, in Chapter 2 “Usability and Psychology” of
“Security Engineering” [@Anderson2008sea].
