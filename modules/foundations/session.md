There is one interactive session for this module (see the [schedule][schedule] 
for date and time). Before that session, work through the material found in
the [Foundations module][ScalableLearning] in Scalable Learning. There are also 
reading instructions in the [study guide][studyguide] (Section 3.2).

During the session we will go through any questions that occured during the 
videos. It's an opportunity to summarize (together) the most important parts 
and discuss the most difficult/ambiguous/strange/counter-intuitive parts.
