@Anderson2008sea introduces the problem of inference control in Chapter 9.3. 
Dwork proposed Differential Privacy as a solution to this problem. The basic 
theory of differential privacy is covered by Chapters 1–2
(with optional material in Chapter 3) of [@DifferentialPrivacyBook].

For some interesting examples of differential privacy, see the following 
articles (not mandatory reading):
