\section{Scope and aims}%
\label{sec:aim}
The aim of the course is that after the course you should be able to make 
high-level designs for secure solutions, \ie combine relevant research results 
based on their high-level properties into a solution with the desired security, 
privacy and usability properties.
The problems and solutions can be in both the technical or organizational 
domain.

\section{Course structure and overview}%
\label{CourseStructure}

The course is divided into three parts.
The first part of the course covers the foundations of security: what it is, 
how to evaluate new knowledge in the field.
This covers both purely technical aspects, but also includes human aspects such
as usability --- even if a system is proved secure, it will offer no security 
if its human users cannot use it.

The second part of the course covers information security on a strategic level, 
this concerns organizational management systems for information security: how 
to implement these and how to continuously run them in an organization.
It also includes threat and risk analysis.
The main material is produced by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) 
and is based on the ISO 27000 standard.

The third part of the course covers the technical aspects: how to design 
security (and not to design security).
The focus in this part of the course is on security mechanisms and how to use 
these in secure systems.

\subsection{Teaching and tutoring}

The teaching of the course is oriented towards active learning.
\Ie the course consists of learning sessions which requires active 
participation.

Generally, you are expected to read the material in advance.
During the learning session the most important parts of the material will be 
discussed and you will perform some tasks to work with the topic in groups, 
\ie to apply it to learn it more efficiently.
Some modules of the course will have several learning sessions linked together,
\eg a starting seminar, followed by laboratory work which is then summarized 
and used in a final seminar.

\subsection{Schedule}

In \cref{Schedule} you will find an overview of the schedule for the course.
The detailed schedule can be found in the University's central scheduling 
system.
The details for each session can be found in Section~\ref{CourseContents}.
