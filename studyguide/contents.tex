\section{Scope and aims}
\label{sec:aim}
The aim of the course is that after the course you should be able to make 
high-level designs for secure solutions, i.e.\ combine relevant research results 
based on their high-level properties into a solution with the desired security, 
privacy and usability properties.
The problems and solutions can be in both the technical or organizational 
domain.

\subsection{\Aclp*{ILO}}

More concretely, after completing the course, you should be able to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{evaluate} the usability of security solutions and \emph{suggest} 
    improvements that improve usability and security.
  \item \emph{evaluate} threats, possible protection mechanisms and 
    \emph{design} a high-level approach to protection which considers 
    usability.
  \item \emph{overview} the field of information security, \emph{understand} 
    your own limits and where to search for solutions, e.g.\ experts or 
    published research results that are relevant to the solution of a problem.
  \item \emph{analyse and apply} the results of published research in the 
    security field.
  \item \emph{apply} the Swedish Civil Contingency Agency's Framework for 
    Information Security Management Systems (ISO 27000) to \emph{analyse, assess 
      and improve} the information security in an organization.
\end{itemize}
The course has a variety of learning sessions designed to ensure that you learn 
these \acp{ILO}.
Each such session has a set of further specified \acp{ILO} that will help you 
achieve the \acp{ILO} above.

We will apply the following grading criteria.
% XXX Rewrite the grading criteria
\begin{description}
  \item[Grade E] You fulfil all the \acp{ILO}, \dots
  \item[Grade C] \dots
  \item[Grade A] You fulfil all the \acp{ILO},
    your evaluations and designs are extensive and well-founded in the 
    state-of-the-art research literature, where applicable, and otherwise show 
    deep insights in how to use the building-blocks from the literature.
\end{description}
The grades B and D are intermediary grades, e.g.\ if all criteria of E are 
fulfilled, the majority but not all of C, then the result will be D.

\section{Course structure and overview}
\label{CourseStructure}

The course is divided into three parts.
The first part of the course covers the foundations of security: what it is, 
how to evaluate new knowledge in the field.
This covers both purely technical aspects, but also includes human aspects such
as usability --- even if a system is proved secure, it will offer no security 
if its human users cannot use it.

The second part of the course covers information security on a strategic level, 
this concerns organizational management systems for information security: how 
to implement these and how to continuously run them in an organization.
It also includes threat and risk analysis.
The main material is produced by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) 
and is based on the ISO 27000 standard.

The third part of the course covers the technical aspects: how to design 
security (and not to design security).
The focus in this part of the course is on security mechanisms and how to use 
these in secure systems.

\subsection{Teaching and tutoring}

The teaching of the course is oriented towards active learning.
I.e.\ the course consists of learning sessions which requires active 
participation.

Generally, you are expected to read the material in advance.
During the learning session the most important parts of the material will be 
discussed and you will perform some tasks to work with the topic in groups, 
i.e.\ to apply it to learn it more efficiently.
Some modules of the course will have several learning sessions linked together,
e.g.\ a starting seminar, followed by laboratory work which is then summarized 
and used in a final seminar.

\subsection{Schedule}

In \cref{Schedule} you will find an overview of the schedule for the course.
The detailed schedule can be found in the University's central scheduling 
system.
The details for each session can be found in \cref{CourseContents}.

\section{Assessment}
\label{Assessment}

This section explains how the course modules are graded and mapped to LADOK\@.
\Cref{LADOKTable} visualizes the relations between modules, credits, grades and 
LADOK\@.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \setlength{\tabcolsep}{0.5em}
  \begin{tabular}{r r l l}
    \toprule
    LADOK & ECTS  & Grade       & Course assignments\\
    \midrule
    I104  & 1.5   & P, F        & M1, M2, S3\\
    L104  & 1.5   & P, F        & L4, L5\\
    R104  & 4.5   & A--F        & P6\\
    \midrule
    Total & 7.5   & A--F        & P6\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{%
    Table summarizing course modules and their mapping to LADOK\@.
    P means pass, F means fail.
    A--E are also passing grades, where A is the best.
  }\label{LADOKTable}
\end{table}

The project report is graded from A to F, where A--E are for passing and F and 
Fx are for failing.
The project also includes an oral presentation which is graded pass (P) or fail 
(F), and is reported with the project to LADOK\@.
The grade of the project will also be the grade of the course total.

\subsection{Handed-in assignments}

In general, all hand-ins in the course must be in a \enquote{passable} 
condition; i.e.~they must be well-written, grammatically correct and without 
spelling errors, have citations and references according to~\cite{IEEEcitation} 
(see also~\cite{PurdueCitation} for a tutorial), and finally fulfil all 
requirements from the assignment instruction.
If you hand something in which is not in this condition, you will receive an 
F without further comment.

All material handed-in must be created by yourself, or, in the case of group 
assignments, created by you or one of the group members.
When you refer to or quote other texts, then you must provide a correct list of 
references and, in the case of quotations, the quoted text must be clearly 
marked as quoted.
If any part of the document is plagiarised you risk being suspended from study 
for a predetermined time, not exceeding six months, due to disciplinary 
offence.
If it is a group assignment, all group members will be held accountable for 
disciplinary offence unless it is clearly marked in the work who is responsible 
for the part containing the plagiarism.

If cooperation takes place without the assignment instruction explicitly 
allowing this, this will be regarded as a disciplinary offence with the risk of
being suspended for a predetermined time, not exceeding six months.
Unless otherwise stated, all assignments are to be done individually.
